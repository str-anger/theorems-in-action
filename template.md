Each topic should include the following chapters.

1. Theorem of hypothesis proper statement. If statement is ambiguous, select one which will be used further.
2. Motivation to include this theorem in this repository. Industrial applications and derivations.
3. If this is a theorem, the chapter should include clear, explicit, and the simplest proof. If other proofs available, they should be referenced. If this is a hypothesis, this hypothesis should be justified. Some statements might relate to real world data, thus justification may appeal to real world observations.
4. Software implementation of the idea with jupyter notebook. This must include illustrative plots.
5. Exercises for self-assessment. There should be at least one task to solve, which (if involves discussed theorem) will have the best solution, compared to straightforward implementation.
